He needs help with a project, a special one he said. Elias hesitantly arrives at his father's workshop.  Thomas, his face etched with age and experience, smiles warmly.  \"Son, good to see you.\"  Elias, surprised, manages a small smile. Thomas: This cradle...I'm making it for my grandchild. Father and son work together, their hands moving in a rhythm born of shared experience.  Elias learns about his father's life, his values. Thomas sees the man his son has become.  The air is filled with the scent of sawdust and unspoken love. Elias:  Thanks, Dad.  It's beautiful.",
